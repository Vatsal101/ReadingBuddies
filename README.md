# ReadingBuddies

Reading Buddies is a website for avid book enthusiats to find books based on their genre/genres of interest. These Books can be added to a list which readers can use to keep track of books they are currently reading or which they have read. 
This project taught me a lot about web development, UI/UX, and webscraping
